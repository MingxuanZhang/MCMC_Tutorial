Getting Started
***************

Before you play around with our tutorial, first install Jupyter Notebook:

.. code:: bash

    pip install jupyter

or use ``pip3`` if needed.

.. note::

    You can also install `Anaconda Python 3.6 <https://www.anaconda.com/download>`__, which downloads both Python 3.6 and Jupyter.
