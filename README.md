## Motivation

A short description of the motivation behind the creation and maintenance of the project. This should explain **why** the project exists.

## Usage

### Local Usage

**Installing Jupyter:** Before you play around with our tutorial, first install Jupyter Notebook:

```sh
pip install jupyter
```

Please note that if `pip` is connected to Python 2.7 on your computer, then you can also try `pip3`. You can also install [Anaconda Python 3.6](https://www.anaconda.com/download), which downloads both Python 3.6 and Jupyter.

**Cloning Repo & Starting Jupyter Server:** After you have installed Jupyter, run the following commands:

```sh
# Clone the tutorial repo
git clone https://github.com/MingxuanZhang/MCMC_Tutorial
# Go to the repo directory
cd MCMC_Tutorial
# Start the Jupyter server
jupyter notebook
```

After executing the last command, you should be redirected to a localhost server in your browser. Click on the tutorials you want to view, which are listed above... and have a blast!

### Web Usage

**TODO**

## Contributors

Please enjoy the code and offer us any suggestions. It is our aim to make the tutorials accessible and usable by all, so that anyone can easily pick up MCMC thinking. We are always interested to hear about potential improvements to the tutorial... [suggestions](../../issues/) and pull requests are highly encouraged!
