## Tech Stack

- [seaborn](https://github.com/mwaskom/seaborn) - Statistical data visualization using matplotlib.
- [tqdm](https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm) - A fast, extensible progress bar for Python and CLI.
- *TODO:* [mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy) - Static typing for Python 2 and 3.

<!-- Here's some interesting repos exploring MCMCs:

- [AustinRochford / webmc3](https://github.com/AustinRochford/webmc3)
- [Chi-Feng / MCMC-Demo](https://github.com/chi-feng/mcmc-demo)

And for fun, I just found [livepython](https://github.com/agermanidis/livepython), which lets you visualize your code run! Here's how to set it up:

1. Run `npm install livepython -g`
2. Run `livepython [name of python file]`
3. Press `V` in the window that just opened
4. Sit back and enjoy! :smile: -->
